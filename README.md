Repo for all work relating to the Robinhood tick/mosquito project
R Files has the work for the exponential mosquito TPC (as well as the out-of-species predictions) and the quadratic tick TPC (as well as the out-of species predictions). 
Raw R Files (Extra) has the same but using the raw data. It should be noted that these mosquito fits uses a quadratic TPC, and the simulated mosquito data using a quadratic TPC is also in this folder. These files are included for completeness, but are not used in the actual analysis.
